# Demeter - WIP

This is an attempt to build an easily extensible React application using serialized components.

It's also a chance to play with THREE.js, using React-THREE to bind the two.

## Usage

Clone or download the repo, then:

1. `cd /path/to/repo/client`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

*Requires browser WebGL support and may not work in Safari.  Try refreshing the browser window/tab if at first you see nothing.*

Use standard click, drag and scrollwheel operations to navigate the 3D space.
