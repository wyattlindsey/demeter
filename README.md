# Demeter - WIP

This is an attempt to build a large React application using serialized components.

It's also a chance to play with THREE.js, using React-THREE to bind the two.

## Usage

Clone or download the repo, then:

1. `cd /path/to/repo/client`
2. `npm install`
3. `gulp`

Use standard click, drag and scrollwheel operations to navigate the 3D space.
While a tool is selected using the toolbar to the left, hold down the **Alt/Opt** in addition to clicking, dragging or scrolling.
